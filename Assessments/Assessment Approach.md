With a goal to determine the Government of Canada's (GC) preferred open source platforms, the following steps are being taken to ensure an open and collaborative process.

**1. Assessment criteria based upon:**

- Existing Government of Canada policies, standards, and guidelines
- Open standards and best practices
- Domain-specific industry standards and best practices

Sample criteria can be found in the [assessment template](Template.md)

**2. Collaborative assessment against criteria:**

- Leveraging open source knowledge from domain experts to complete assessments
- GC Configurations to be assessed will be contributed by the community based on existing and emerging platforms
- If you would like to assess a platform that you don't see listed, [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to add a new assessment file using the [assessment template](Template.md)

**3. Consult with open source community:**

- Assessments will be shared through existing open source communities within and external to the GC
- Communities of practice are being established to help develop assessments, validate criteria, and consult with domain experts in a meaningful way.
- Consultations will be completed online and in-person

**4. GC Governance:**

- Following the completion of the collaborative process for assessment and consultations, recommendations for preferred open source platforms will be provided to the GC's Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) for review.
- If the recommendation for preferred platform is approved by EARB, it will be added to the list on the [Open Resource Exchange](../Open_Resource_Exchange.md).
- Internal governance will continue to adopt preferred platforms within necessary GC Standards and Guidelines.
