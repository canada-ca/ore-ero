<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Open Source Code</h1>
<p>
  Open source code commonly refers to software that uses an open development process. This software is released under a license where
  the copyright holder grants anyone permission to use, modify, change or redistribute the code for any purpose. This open source process
  is an example of open collaboration where everyone benefits from the development of technology that solves real issues.
